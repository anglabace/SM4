 * Represents an address for publication of an AMQP message. The AMQP 0-8 and 0-9
 * specifications have an unstructured string that is used as a "reply to" address.
 * There are however conventions in use and this class makes it easier to

 * <p>
 * <pre class="code">
 * (exchange)/(routingKey)
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Here we also the exchange name to default to empty
 * (so just a routing key will work if you know the queue name).
